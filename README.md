# Simulation Experiments
## Simulation Setup
(1) Terrain models

The normal terrain model was manually designed by using terrain generator software. The complex terrain model was generated by remote sensing terrain data.

(2) Robot models

The UAV model was an open-source model called iris and was equppied with a downward solid-state LiDAR called Livox-Mid360. The UGV model was SCOUT MINI which was produced by AGILE·X and carried a VLP-16 LiDAR with 0.1m∼30m measurement range and 10Hz data frequency
